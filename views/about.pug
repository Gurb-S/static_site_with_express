          p I'm an immigrant from India who moved to the US as a child. I have always been a curious person and try to make even the most complicated things simple. This is a reason I love learning JavaScript. We use the web every single day, from checking sports scores to watching videos posted online by strangers hundreds, if not thousands, of miles away. By learning JavaScript I can learn how all this works but also create applications and websites that use this technology. Once you learn that the buttons you click on a website are just images that don't do anything other than tell some code to run, it's hard to unsee it.
